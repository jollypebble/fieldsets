# Diagrams
Diagrams are [x,y] coordinate based areas that are used for interactive visualization of fieldsets. This core Diagram component instantiates a diagram standardized data store for session based, local persistant, and remote persistant data cache. Accessing this data store will allow you to track where a user is interacting and what visualizations need to be triggered.
