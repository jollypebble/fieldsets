# Sheet Components #
Sheet components are components that render a single fieldset.
But the idea is that sheets can vary in complexity, and sheet containers can be made of a number of sheet components and fieldsets as well. The simplest sheet components such as lists, tables, & grids and worksheets can be found in [the core sheet types sub directory](../Core/Sheet/SheetTypes).
