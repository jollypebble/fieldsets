# Set Views #
This component directory contains various set views for rendering the display associated with a set. We have not defined any setviews in the core directory as these views will heavily vary from application to application. A set view can be a point on a line chart or a complex Canvas or SVG drawing. Setviews represent the visual user interaction with a given set.
