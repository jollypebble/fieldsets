# Sets
In the Fieldsets Framework, a set is an abstract collection of related data. A set represents a hierarchical parent child relationship of numerous data points and stores information about the set. For Fieldsets in particular, a Set provides a collection of related fields whose values may need to be aggregated later in timeseries or snapshot form and it's meta information provides information on how to visually render the set.

For a React Visual FieldSets project, a FieldSet consists of a a listing of fields, subsets and meta information about the set itself. One of these meta data points is called a SetView, which is the way we specify to view a given set. In our example, a SetView represents an SVG shape. Each SetView, can specify a Label, which is the way we render the legend or header of a set. The SetView can also specify a group component, which wraps parents and their children in referencable groups that can be used further down the ancestry line.

This component directory contains various views for rendering the display associated with a set. We have not defined any views in the core directory as these views will heavily vary from application to application. The same can be said for groups and labels. In our example, we are simply setting our generic SVG label and groups as the default for all of our SetViews. But in reality SetView can be a point on a d3 line chart or a complex Canvas drawing or an image.
