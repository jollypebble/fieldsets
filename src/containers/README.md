# Containers
Containers can be though of as top level data sets. A single container will only interact with the set of data assigned to it.

Containers are developer defined collections of components and data points. Theoretically the application itself can be coded using containers and passing props to each of the components in the container. There are probably many places where this is not true, but the goal is to abstract components away enough that was can assemble various data visualizations by defining multiple containers within an app.
