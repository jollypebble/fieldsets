# Containers#
In the visual field sets framework, containers are groupings of components. The following container types exist.

* Sheets - Sheets are groupings of Fields/Fieldsets
* UI - UI containers are grid based groupings of components. These interfaces typically conform to organizing components defined by react-md and establishing interactions with them and other containers/components in the app.
* Diagrams - Diagram components are data driven organization of components and use a x,y coordinate system for placement of items in the diagram.
