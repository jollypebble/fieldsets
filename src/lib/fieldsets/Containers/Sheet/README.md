# Diagrams
Diagrams are SVG based [x,y] coordinate areas that are used for interactive visualization of fieldsets. They use a combination of input fields and visual output. This core Diagram component instantiates a diagram standardized data store for session based, local persistent, and remote persistent data cache. Accessing this data store will allow you to track where a user is interacting and what visualizations need to be triggered.
